Hi, my name is Maxwell and I am a software engineer from New York who specializes in full-stack web development. I'm currently working as a senior front-end engineer with the lovely people at [DoSomething.org](http://wwww.dosomething.org/).

When I'm not writing code or pushing pixels, I've been known to enjoy nature and a well-made cocktail.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:hi@mmwtsn.com?subject:Hello!) or find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mmwtsn).
